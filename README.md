# Passenger Counter App

# About
This was part of the Scrimba course on creating a passenger counter app. It was using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a passenger counter app which when clicked would log how many passengers passed through the station each time. 
Clicking would reset the counter to 0 but store the last figure so you know what the total passengers were for that day. 

Still needs some work but Its a good start so far.

I will be adding more over time as I get more comfortable with coding language.
